Description
Lab Overview
An attractive feature of the cloud is that you can deploy applications in multiple data centers making them highly available and able to tolerate a high degree of failures. In this Lab, you will deploy a secure and highly available website with Terraform on AWS using a two-tier architecture with private and public subnets. The web servers and Elastic Load Balancer will span multiple availability zones to achieve high availability.

Lab Objectives
Upon completion of this Lab you will be able to:

Apply infrastructure changes in Terraform
Configure all the network and security infrastructure needed to deploy a highly available website
Use user data to bootstrap web servers
Destroy infrastructure managed by Terraform
Lab Prerequisites
